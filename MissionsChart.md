## This section determine every points that make a good mission

### 1 - The mission must be technically feasible
The [BingoLol](https://github.com/TrOllOchamO/BingoLol) currently work by consulting the [Live Client Data API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#game-client-api_live-client-data-api).
This API allow users to get some infos on the game the player is currently in, but not much. (for example you dont have any informations on pings, or chat)
Meaning any missions based on some infos not provided by this API will not be considered.

### 2 - The mission must be balanced
The mission should be not to hard not too easy, typically a mission like "You steal a nashor" has a probablility way too low. It would completly block a line and a column of the bingo and this is not fun.

### 3 - The mission should not compel the player to troll
It doesn't mean banning any mission that complete when the player team is behind. If it was the case the game would become boring when played on the losing team. But avoid as much as possible mission that force the player to troll (for example a mission like "die twice before the 5th minute" would be a terrible mission)

### 4 - The mission should be completable for the maximum of role
There is obviously exeptions but the mission should try to not target a specifyed role or champion. For example a mission like "finish 2 towers on top lane" would be way to hard to complete by laners other thant top. Same goes for champions the mission should fit for every champions.

### 5 - The mission should not be determinate in champion select
This point complete the one above, a mission should complete or not during the game. A mission that is either lost or won befor the game even started isn't fun. A good mission rely either on the player actions or on luck. Typically a mission like "There is a yasuo in the game" or "4 player has an ignite" are not good missions.
